# Background
A classical segmentation tutorial in MATLAB, on the subject of tadpole embryos.

The information was originally used as a tutorial to help a graduate research assistant at the University of Alabama at Birmingham to increase their programming skills.

The purpose of the project is to understand how the measurable dimensions of tadpoles change with certain mutations. The example script only measures pixel area, but could be enhanced to approximate width and length of most tadpoles using `bwskel()` and `bwdist()`.
